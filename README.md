# Exploration-Of-Genetic-Algorithm-Efficiency
## Workup: Environment, Bots, and Evolution
If you are interested only in the results, skip to the results section. Otherwise, We start from Here:
### Environment
First we Create the ground plane:

We Add Gravity, Collisions, and a Friction. We also add a box to show that our physics are working corectly
## Gravity:

## When the block is moved, it comes to a stop due to the bullet physics engine's friction:

# Bots!

## A Bot is made from these cube shaped blocks. 
They can be any shape, but for demonstration purposes, they will be made of cubes:

## One cube is a bot. So is Two cubes:
