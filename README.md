# Exploration-Of-Genetic-Algorithm-Efficiency
## Workup: Environment, Bots, and Evolution
If you are interested only in the results, skip to the results section. Otherwise, We start from Here:
### Environment
First we Create the ground plane:

We Add Gravity, Collisions, and a Friction. We also add a box to show that our physics are working corectly
Gravity:
